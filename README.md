## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Sass
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This project helped me practice interacting with 3rd-party APIs.
It has allowed me to improve my skills and learn more about how to use APIs with React.

### Continued development

I will continue improving my knowledge about how to use APIs and the best way to interact with them.

### Useful resources

-   [Scrimba](www.scrimba.com) - The Scrimba course _Learn React for free with Bob Ziroll_ has been a great resource to improve my knowledge about both React and interactions with APIs.
